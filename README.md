MOVIES_PERFORMANCE IN THE MARKET

This project is about top watched movies in the market,audience rating and the gross each movie generates every time it is watched.

The main purpose of this project is to analyse how the audience rates the movies and from the analysis of these ratings,it is easy to decide
on which movies are selling the best and thus moves fast preventing stocking of those whose consumptions is low.
The movies analysed were scrapped from IMDb website,cleaned,explored and visualized using the following:
* BeautifulSoups
* Pandas
* Matplotlib.pyplot
* seaborn
* numpy
From the analysis of the top performing movies,none of the movies had a rating of below 8.0 and this means for a new movie studio,
these 250 movies are to go for without a risk of having dead stock.
